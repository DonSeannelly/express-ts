# express-ts

This project is meant to serve as a starting point for building an application in Express, all while leveraging the benefits of TypeScript.

The goal is that this project will provide a structure that is easy to comprehend, modular by design, and easily expandable for other applications. It is my hope that this project will allow newcomers from different backgrounds to be able to quickly get started with, and understand, web development with Node.
